# Wordle Game

Wordle is a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden five-letter word. This project is a browser-based implementation of the game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Wordle-Game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Wordle-Game

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

   The game will load in your browser, and you can start playing.

## Features

- **Information Tab:** Access game instructions and tips on how to play.

## How to Play

1. Start typing to input your guesses. Letters will appear in the boxes.
2. Use the 'DEL' button to remove letters.
3. Hit 'Enter' to submit your guess.
4. Green background: Correct letter in the correct spot.
5. Yellow background: Correct letter in the wrong spot.
6. Grey background: Incorrect letter.
7. Click the '?' icon for a hint if needed.

## Build Your Own Wordle
To build your Wordle game, follow these steps:

1. Use a random word generator API to fetch five-letter words.
2. Implement the logic for checking guesses and providing feedback.
3. Customize the styling and UI elements to fit your preferences.

**Note:** For the 'Hint' feature, you will need to integrate an API that provides hints for the corresponding words. The API should return hints that can be displayed to the user when the hint button is clicked.


Feel free to make any further adjustments as needed for your specific project.
